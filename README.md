# Rick and Morty React Native App

This project is my first approach to the react-native framework, which is a great framework for the development of mobile applications with javascript since it allows to use of the knowledge of front-end development for the creation of mobile applications. simple, use the rick and Morty API to get the data and display it in a UI.

When using this framework, it must be taken into account that the installation of all the necessary tools in the work environment is the most complicated part, luckily in the following blog (which is the fastest and easiest guide I have seen) shows how to install all the necessary software to work with react native.

The UI is very simple as all you have to do is display the data coming from the server and render it on these cards shown below.

Each card redirects to the character's profile where you can see his stats and mark him as a favourite in the upper right.

The navigation between sections is very similar to other applications with a lower bar that serves to change the section, this is the section of characters, locations, episodes and favourites.

![locations](https://daniel-carrete.vercel.app/images/projects_images/react_native_rick_and_morty/locations.png)

Similarly, each section has its details screen for each item.

And in the favourites section, the favourite characters you have selected are saved locally.
